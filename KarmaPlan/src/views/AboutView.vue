      <p>KaramaPlan helps you to track your completed chores!
        You can only track yourself, together with your significant Other or your household. 
        You can check on "How much did I do" and compare your chores in a weekly or monthly sight. 
        You can use this tool to make unvisible chores more visible and have a understanding of who's doing how much at home on top of your regular Job. 
        Maybe this will help you, having a conversation about sharing responsibilities at your home.
